Odin Project Recipe Site

This project will be a quick-and-dirty (aka "brutalist") website that will bring together all the HTML skills developed in the first few HTML lessons of the Odin Project. It should include different paragraph and header styles, lists, images, links (both absolute and relative), and a solid history of commit messages.
