    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Arepas are a food found mainly in Colombia and Venezuela, as well as the diaspora around the world. Similar to <a href="https://www.acozykitchen.com/how-to-make-pupusas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pupusas</a>, these corn patties let you make your own combination.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Masa arepa</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: this is NOT the same as regular masa. It needs to be a <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/masarepa-precooked-corn-flour-for-making-arepas-3029290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very specific type of masa </a>for it to work.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Avocado, sliced</li>
            <li>Black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>Queso fresco, crumbled</li>
            <li>Eggs, scrambled</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cooking oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix (by hand!) the masa arepa and a pinch of salt with water in a roughly 1:1 ratio until the texture is right.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a towel and let the masa sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, start heating the cooking oil on high heat.</li>
            <li>When the masa is ready, start forming it into balls, then flatten them into patties about half an inch thick.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The dough should not be so dry it cracks but not so wet it sticks to your hands too much.</li>
                    <li>Add more water or more masa as needed to get the consistency right.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F</li>
            <li>Fry the patties a few minutes on each side until firm. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some char marks are totally fine here!</li>
                </ul>
            <li>When all the arepas have been fried, put them on a baking sheet in the oven for ~15 minutes.</li>
            <li>When they are done baking, enjoy!</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Slice them open horizontally, creating a pocket.</li>
                    <li>Fill with the avocado, eggs. black beans, and queso to your liking.</li>
                    <li>Eat them and be happy :)</li>
                </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to experiment with other types of fillings (just never <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/tdwpbp/peanut_butter_jelly_arepas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> peanut butter</a> or tomatoes)</p>
