    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tasty take on the classic eggplant parmesan is a great meal any time of year, and gluten-free to boot!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium eggplants</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Note: these should be the purple ones, not the  <a href="https://specialtyproduce.com/produce/White_Eggplant_189.php#:~:text=White%20eggplant%20is%20native%20to,regions%20in%20the%20modern%20day." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strange little white ones</a> for this recipe.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>1 large can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 container of whole milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Lots of fresh basil</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Hot italian peppers</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic, peeled and separated into cloves</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese to taste</li>
            <li>Olive oil (lots of it!)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Slice the eggplant into 1/4-inch slices.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the eggplant slices liberally with salt and allow to sit for five minutes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This step gets a lot of the bitter water out of the eggplant. You will likely see them "sweating"</li>
                <li>Wipe off the water at the end of the five minutes and proceed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>While the eggplants are sitting, chop some basil and mix it into the ricotta, along with the Italian spices.</li>
            <li>Fry the eggplant slices in oil a few minutes per side, until they soften a bit and you can roll them. Set them aside until all are done.</li>
            <li>Lay out the eggplant slices and put a dollop of the seasoned ricotta on each one, then roll them into a medium-tight roll.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have too much ricotta, just eat whatever is left :P</li>
                    <li>If you don't have enough ricotta, take a little from each one and spread it around to make it work.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Mix the crushed tomatoes with the hot italian peppers to taste. I like it spicy!</li>
            <li>In a large lined baking sheet, spread the tomato sauce to evenly cover the bottom.</li>
            <li>Place the eggplant rolls evenly throughout the sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the whole cloves of garlic in any open spaces left in the pan.</li>
            <li>Bake the whole thing for ~20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When they are done baking, enjoy!</li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Grate or slice some parmesan on top for extra cheesiness.</li>
                    <li>Add some more hot peppers if you need more spice.</li>
                    <li>Eat them and be happy :)</li>
                </ol>
        </ol>
